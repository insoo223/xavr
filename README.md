# xavr
AVR code dev on legacy Xcode IDE of MacBook 2009 
* Background: 
I have my white old but lovely MacBook (mid 2009) with RAM 2G (DDR2), CPU Intel Core 2 Duo (2.13 GHz). It has very nice key touching, soft glaring screen and 13 inch display is good enough to development tasks.
* So what: I have a hobby of DIY using Arduino or other barebone AVR MCUs. Having googled for some time, I've found https://github.com/jawher/xavr for rejuvenating my white dog.
* Purpose: This is a scratch pad for playing around "xavr" template with Xcode on MacBook 2009.
* Install & Use "xavr" template: 1) Download the github mentioned above 2) Run "python setup.py" 3) Close and Open Xcode, you can find "xavr" in the new project window.
